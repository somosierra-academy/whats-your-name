<h1>What's your name</h1>
Grasp the foundations of Natural Language Processing

Maybe you've listened to some news about an amazing tool called ChatGPT. Maybe you've tried it and maybe your jaw dropped when you started to interact with it, or with "her/him"...
ChatGPT is only the beginning, the technology beneath this ChatBot has blown up and you're going to see things you've never expected.

But... what's ChatGPT? Well, using Machine Learning terminology, ChatGPT is a Natural Language Processing system that uses a combination of Transformers model to generate human-comprehensive texts.

You've read above two new terms, Natural Language Processing and Transformers. This notebook gently introduces you to the technology behind Natural Language Processing.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of study in computer science and artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. The goal of NLP is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, whether spoken or written.

NLP involves various techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, and linguistics, to process and analyze natural language data, such as text and speech. Applications of NLP include language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and speech recognition.
